# Understanding the Project's Structure

## General Info About the Project ðŸ“– {#general-info}

This is a terminal application that allows developers to generate logos (maybe a better term would be banner) for their projects. It uses the following technologies for the development process and for the build pipeline:

- [PDM](https://pdm-project.org/en/latest/) for development scripts and managing (dev)dependencies.
- [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for linting and formatting
- [Pyright](https://microsoft.github.io/pyright/#/) for type checking
- [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) for unit tests

You can install PDM with the following command:

```bash
curl -sSL https://pdm-project.org/install-pdm.py | python3 -
```

The project also uses [`Vitepress`](https://vitepress.dev/) for generating the [documentation website](https://octologo.skwal.net).
