# Credits

I had the idea to create this project after seeing the logos made by [adi1090x](https://github.com/adi1090x) for his repositories. They were simple but gave a nice feel to his projects. I wanted a logo that gives the same energy, but didn't manage to find how he made them (most likely manually, with GIMP according the the exif data of the images). So I decided to make a program that would allow anyone to generate a cool and simple logo for their projects.

- [adi1090x's GitHub](https://github.com/adi1090x)

# Usage

First, clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SkwalExe/octo-logo
cd octo-logo
```

Then, install the dependencies

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

And finally, launch the program and follow the instructions

```bash
python3 src/main.py
```
