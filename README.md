<p align="center">ðŸ’  Simple program that generates a logo for your open source projects ðŸ’ </p>

# Credits

I had the idea to create this project after seeing the logos made by [adi1090x](https://github.com/adi1090x) for his repositories. They were simple but gave a nice feel to his projects. I wanted a logo that gives the same energy, but didn't manage to find how he made them (most likely manually, with GIMP according the the exif data of the images). So I decided to make a program that would allow anyone to generate a cool and simple logo for their projects.

# How to install ðŸ“¥

You can install octologo easily with pip:

```bash
python3 -m pip install octologo
```

You can also use [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/):

```bash
pipx install octologo
```

Now, start the app with:

```bash
octologo
```

> [!CAUTION]
> If the command is not found after installtion, you must add  `~/.local/bin` to your path. You can do this by adding `export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin` to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file.

```bash
# For bash
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin' >> ~/.bashrc

# For zsh
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin' >> ~/.zshrc
```

# Styles

### Style 1 - First letters underlined

> The number of letters to underline is customizable since version 2.0.0
